You might need a bit more cottage or ricotta cheese, especially if splitting between smaller pans. Also, you will only get two levels deep if you don't have a really deep pan. Our contribution to this recipe comes from Ashley's mother, which is adding a package of spicy Italian sausage to give some additional flavor.
